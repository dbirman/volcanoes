We staggered the really difficult days of the low to high trip with two active rest days in between on days 2 and 4. The plan for day 2 was to mostly bike downhill into the Panamint valley for 10 miles (west of Death Valley) and then ride rolling terrain to the Panamint Springs Resort, a small campground and restaurant on the western edge of the park. With just 30 miles of riding total we expected to have plenty of time to rest and enjoy the views of the mountains surrounding us.

We woke up at 3am and drove the last hour down to Badwater Basin, eating a few snacks on the way there. One of the lucky aspects of our trip was that we had an almost full moon for the entire week and a forecast for clear skies on most days. When we got to Badwater at 4am we were treated to a rare moonset, highlighting the Panamint range and Telescope peak on the left.

After that, we ditched the car and got moving.
