Mt Shasta stands alone at the north end of California, a formidable mountain without anything comparable nearby. By prominence and isolation Shasta is second only to Mt Rainier in the continental US rising over 10,000' above its plateau and with the next mountain of similar height being in the Sierras three hundred miles to the south. Even more remarkable is that Shastina, the older volcanic peak connected to the main mountain, is over 12,000' tall making it comparable in size to Lassen! Unfortunately, this year was an exceptionally low snow year and Shastina is almost snow free already at the end of March.

Shasta is built from four major volcanic cones, the Hotlum cone is currently the tallest, formed 8,000 years ago, and is still active with obvious fumaroles venting sulfur onto the summit plateau. Just to the south is Misery hill, a remnant of one of the earlier volcanic eruptions. Misery hill forms a false summit, blocking views of the true summit and is often the end of the road for many ascentionists. Getting to the summit of the Hotlum cone by the easiest route, Avalanche Gulch, involves +7300' of elevation gain to the peak at 14,179' over about 5.75 miles and is often done in two days with an overnight at Horse Camp (at 8000) or Helen's Lake (at 10,600).
