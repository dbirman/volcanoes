## Whitney Portal

To kick off the trip we needed a full day of gear caching and driving, just to set everything up for later on. The first step was to put a car at the Whitney Portal, which is the trailhead leading to the Mt Whitney mountaineer's route which we planned to ascend five days later.

In Winter the portal road is gated about 2 miles below the trailhead. So we drove up in the morning and parked Jacob (the twilight blue Outback) at the gate and threw in our winter camping and mountaineering gear. Le Cheval stayed behind to guard everything and keep any enterprising mice at bay.

Before leaving the sky cleared up just enough for us to barely glimpse Telescope peak far in the distance, behind the Inyo Range mountains that you can see closer in the image below. Badwater Basin is in Death Valley, behind and far below Telescope.

## Wildrose

After that we drove two hours down into the Owens River Valley, over the Inyo Mountains, down into the Panamint Valley, and then up into the Panamint Range into Emigrant Canyon and up to the base of Telescope Peak at Wildrose campground. It was about 20 degrees warmer here and the sun was blazing, a good sign for melting some of the snow that we could see on top of Telescope.

We sorted our gear and then cached some food, water, and camping supplies along with our bikes at the trailhead. Then we enjoyed a few hours of sunshine and read some books. At this point, spirits were high, but we really didn't know what to expect for the rest of the trip.
