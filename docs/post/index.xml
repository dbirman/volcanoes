      <description>A few boulders sticking out of the snowfield/glacier were great for taking some short breaks behind while we warmed up in the sun. Overall we were pretty optimistic, especially once we got past the top of the lifts.
Compared to Lawetlat&amp;rsquo;la the terrain on Wy&amp;rsquo;east is a completely different nature. In Winter Lwetlat&amp;rsquo;la feels like a huge open ski bowl, you can barely tell that you&amp;rsquo;re on a volcano until you pop out on the summit rim and look down into the massive valley where there used to be a mountain.</description>

      <title>Three Fingered Jack</title>

      <description>Three Fingered Jack is part of a very old volcanic complex that has been eroded over hundreds of thousands of year. This process left behind a dramatic summit of spires made out of totally crumbly volcanoic rock. Because it&amp;rsquo;s in Oregon it&amp;rsquo;s also very very cold. Getting to the summit col involves about +2200&#39; of elevation gain over 4 miles, if you don&amp;rsquo;t get too lost.
So this is the start of the real trip, step one is to drive down to California so that I can then drive back to Seattle!</description>

      <description>The South Side route on Wy&amp;rsquo;east is at the same time a big step up and a big step down from the mellow skiing on the Worm Flows route of the previous week. You start at a ski lodge, and the first half of the south side route is just skiing up past the lifts. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit disheartening to ski for two hours and realize you could have taken a lift the whole way!</description>

      <title>Lawetlat&#39;la (Mt St Helens)</title>

      <description>Lawetlat&amp;rsquo;la is the smallest of the Washington volcanoes but it also has one of the easiest approaches, because the road to the trailhead is plowed, even in winter. To get to the summit is about 5000&#39; of elevation gain and around 5.5 miles each way.
We had a blast of warm weather at the beginning of February which Greg, Allison, and I took advantage of to take a quick trip up Mt St Helens.</description>

      <title>Probable Peak Plan</title>

      <description>From 2015 to 2018 I flew back and forth about two dozen times from the San Francisco airport to the Seattle airport to visit Allison. On each of those flights I tried to get a right-hand seat on the flight north and a left-hand seat on the flight south, so that I would get to watch the Cascade volcanoes as they passed by my window. It seemed like it would make for such a beautiful trip to drive north and ski as many of the volcanoes as possible, but at the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ski (backcountry) and on top of that I had just sold my snowboard.</description>
