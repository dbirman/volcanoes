      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to ski another volcano in 2024 sadly. So 2025 will have to make up for that! I missed two early weather windows in January and March to get out, but I finally caught an excellent spring weather day right after Passover. Loowit is 5000&amp;rsquo; over about 5.5 miles.
For this trip, I tried something different and left late Friday evening planning to spend the night at a rest stop on the drive down.</description>

      <description>Because of the El Nino this year, there is very little snow at low elevations but still plenty of snow up high. This is going to make for great volcano skiing on the big mountains (easy access!) but it&amp;rsquo;s making the early volcano season a bit tricky to navigate. Paul and I tried to take advantage of a brief window in the weather to get on some new snow on Loowit, but we got unlucky and the mountain stayed in a whiteout all day.</description>

      <description>Back to Adams! The cold front weather predictions improved the tiniest bit and it looked like the summit of Adams might be just below freezing with full sun. Good enough for us to take a shot at repeating the Southwest Chutes in what could be perfect corn conditions! Skiing to the summit of Adams and then down the chutes from the campground is an ascent of 7600&amp;rsquo; over 5.5 miles.</description>

      <description>The huge steaming crater on Koma Kulshan is flanked by two major peaks and a few minor ones, Grant on the northwest corner is the main summit at 10,871&amp;rsquo; while Sherman on the southeast corner is its little sibling at 10,165&amp;rsquo;. Unlike the main summit, Sherman is a small mud pinnacle with steep slopes on all sides. Getting to Sherman Peak via the Squak Glacier is an ascent of about 7000&amp;rsquo; over a little more than 5 miles.</description>

      <description>Half a million years old, Pahto is the easternmost of the major Cascade volcanoes and second only to Shasta in total mass of volcanic rock. Pahto has apparently eroded down below the present day height of Loowit more than once in its history, only to be rebuilt again from new eruptions. The present nearly flat summit plateau and false summit are the result of many repeated minor volcanic events. Like Shasta, Pahto has prominent glaciers on its north side but its south side often dries completely in the summer heat.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s better than skiing a volcano? Skiing a volcano twice! Loowit is about 5500&amp;rsquo; of ascent over about 4 miles.
This writeup has a lot more videos than usual because I was out by myself and apparently I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sufficiently distracted by the pain of walking up hill!
   Our first summer (spring?) heat wave has arrived and it made for some pretty promising ski conditions, although with the trailheads still mostly snowed out there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of extra walking to get to most of the volcanoes.</description>

      <description>When I pop over the top of the rim on Loowit I&amp;rsquo;m always astounded by the sheer amount of rock that was blown out of the mountain during the 1980 explosion, it&amp;rsquo;s an incredible and impressive place to be standing and a reminder that we should really move to a different state. The standard winter ascent route on Loowit is the &amp;ldquo;Worm&amp;rsquo;s Flow&amp;rdquo; route which rises about 5000&amp;rsquo; over 5.5 miles, meandering first through the forest before popping out into the sunshine below the main face of the mountain.</description>

      <description>2023! Time to ski some volcanoes! To get back into volcano shape I took a tour up from Paradise with Jess, Julien, and Greg in early January. Keeping our plans mellow given the anticipated blizzard we planned to skin up as far as we could toward Camp Muir (10,188&amp;rsquo;) from Paradise (~5,500&amp;rsquo;) and then turn around whenever weather conditions started looking dicey.
The gate to drive up to Paradise, the main trailhead on the south side of Rainier doesn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:00am, so we had a leisurely departure from Seattle around 6:45 and got our boots on and ready to start walking around 9:30am or so.</description>

      <description>Tacoma is the most volcano volcano in the United States. Its huge bulk of glaciers tower over Seattle (and Portland). Tacoma, like Kulshan, creates its own weather systems because of the short distance between the mountain and the warm ocean air and the dramatic change in elevation as that air rises up the mountain sides. Tacoma is one of the rare mountains in the world which has experienced glacial growth in the last century, although that has reversed in the last thirty years.</description>

      <description>Kulshan stands out amongst the Cascade volcanoes because of its very short distance to the San Juan islands and then the Pacific ocean. The short distance and the lack of large mountains between the ocean and the peak create consistent deep wet snow, which accumulates on the upper elevations into massive glaciers. Kulshan hosts more glacial ice in its thirteen glaciers than all of the other cascade volcanoes (except Tahoma) combined!</description>

      <guid>https://volcano.danbirman.com/post/2022_04_06_bachelor/</guid>
      <description>Mount Bachelor is the only cascade volcano with a ski lift going straight to the summit. A dormant stratovolcano, Bachelor actually sits on top of a shield volcano which has a number of cinder cones in the area. Bachelor last erupted sometime around 10,000 years ago in a series of lava flows but there is no summit crater. Of note is that much of the surface of Bachelor (and nearby volcanoes) is actually ash from the explosion of Mt Mazama which formed modern day Crater Lake.</description>

      <description>Youxlokes and His-chok-wol-as (Mt Thielsen) are a pair of volcanoes on either side of a serene mountain lake. His-chok-wol-as is an ancient volcano compared Youxlokes and has been almost entirely eroded by glaciers which have long since melted out. What remains at the summit is the magma core itself, acting as a dramatic lightning rod for the central cascades. Youxlokes, on the other side of the lake, is a far younger volcano with an obvious summit crater and the classic dome shape we expect at this point.</description>

      <description>M&amp;rsquo;laiksini Yaina is a beautiful mountain near the border of California and Oregon with the classical cone shape of a stratovolcano, meaning that it has been built up by successive eruptions over many years. Driving around the area it pops into view occasionally as you turn corners or pass a lake and anybody who has driven the I5 corridor through Medford has seen it in the distance. This volcano also happens to be fairly isolated, so it&amp;rsquo;s lucky that Allison and I have a friend from Cornell who lives just twenty miles away who lent me her house for the weekend.</description>

      <description>Mt Shasta stands alone at the north end of California, a formidable mountain without anything comparable nearby. By prominence and isolation Shasta is second only to Mt Rainier in the continental US rising over 10,000&amp;rsquo; above its plateau and with the next mountain of similar height being in the Sierras three hundred miles to the south. Even more remarkable is that Shastina, the older volcanic peak connected to the main mountain, is over 12,000&amp;rsquo; tall making it comparable in size to Lassen!</description>

      <description>What stands out most about Mt Whitney is the abrupt sheerness of the east facing cliffs. The whole eastern flank of the Sierras is like a wall, a byproduct of the way the uplift zone is tilting the Sierras up and out of the Owens Rivery Valley. The granite and relatively young age of the mountains also makes for impressively steep valley walls and canyons. Our car was parked at the high gate of the Whitney Portal road, about two miles short of the official trailhead.</description>

      <description>Badwater Basin and Mt Whitney are pretty far apart, even in a straight line by flight. To get from the Panamint Valley at the western edge of Death Valley over to the Sierra Nevadas you don&amp;rsquo;t have much choice: you have to cross over the fairly intimidating Inyo Mountain Range and then make your way through the often windy Owens River Valley to the base of the sharp eastern cliffs of the Sierras.</description>

      <description>We staggered the really difficult days of the low to high trip around two active rest days on days 2 and 4. The plan for day 2 was to mostly bike downhill into the Panamint valley for 10 miles (west of Death Valley) and then ride rolling terrain to the Panamint Springs Resort, a small campground and restaurant on the western edge of the park. With just 30 miles of riding total we expected to have plenty of time to rest and enjoy the views of the mountains surrounding us.</description>

      <guid>https://volcano.danbirman.com/post/2022_03_14_l2h_day1/</guid>
      <description>Day 1 of our trip was by far the most intimidating. About +11,300&amp;rsquo; of elevation gain over the first 21 miles to get from Badwater Basin up to Telescope peak and then another 4,000&amp;rsquo; of descent over 8 miles of trail that wind around Bennett and Roger peaks to get back to our cached bikes and camping gear at the Charcoal Kilns. Neither Alan or I had ever done a day as big as this &amp;ndash; our estimate was that it would take 18 hours to complete and so to make it to the summit by 7pm we planned to start at 4am.</description>

      <description>Whitney Portal To kick off the trip we needed a full day of gear caching and driving, just to set everything up for later on. The first step was to put a car at the Whitney Portal, which is the trailhead leading to the Mt Whitney mountaineer&amp;rsquo;s route which we planned to ascend five days later.
In Winter the portal road is gated about 2 miles below the trailhead. So we drove up in the morning and parked Jacob (the twilight blue Outback) at the gate and threw in our winter camping and mountaineering gear.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a volcano trip, but I snuck it in as a little side trip along the way to skiing all the Cascades!
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a geographical quirk that Mt Whitney, the high point in the continental United States, and Badwater Basin, the low point in the continental US, are only separated by about 100 miles. Death Valley and Badwater Basin in particular are formed by mountain ranges that are being pulled apart by tectonic forces, causing the valley floor to slip lower and lower below sea level.</description>

      <guid>https://volcano.danbirman.com/post/2022_03_11_lassen/</guid>
      <description>Kohm Yah-mah-nee is the high point of the remarkably active Lassen dome volcano, which has peaks that are over a half million years old as well as peaks, like Lassen itself that are barely 30,000 years old. Getting to the summit of Kohm Yah-mah-nee is about +4600&amp;rsquo; of gain up to the peak at 10,450&amp;rsquo;, over a brief 4.5 miles.
Step one to getting to Lassen was the six hour drive from Oregon down, and along the way I was treated to a big surprise&amp;hellip; gas is unbelievably expensive right now!</description>

      <guid>https://volcano.danbirman.com/post/2022_03_09_jack/</guid>
      <description>Three Fingered Jack is part of a very old volcanic complex that has been eroded over hundreds of thousands of year. This process left behind a dramatic summit of spires made out of totally crumbly volcanoic rock. Because it&amp;rsquo;s in Oregon it&amp;rsquo;s also very very cold. Getting to the summit col involves about +2200&amp;rsquo; of elevation gain over 4 miles, if you don&amp;rsquo;t get too lost.
So this is the start of the real trip, step one is to drive down to California so that I can then drive back to Seattle!</description>

      <description>The South Side route on Wy&amp;rsquo;east is at the same time a big step up and a big step down from the mellow skiing on the Worm Flows route of the previous week. You start at a ski lodge, and the first half of the south side route is just skiing up past the lifts. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit disheartening to ski for two hours and realize you could have taken a lift the whole way!</description>

      <description>Loowit is the smallest of the Washington volcanoes but it also has one of the easiest approaches, because the road to the trailhead is plowed, even in winter. To get to the summit is about 5000&amp;rsquo; of elevation gain and around 5.5 miles each way.
We had a blast of warm weather at the beginning of February which Greg, Allison, and I took advantage of to take a quick trip up Mt St Helens.</description>

      <description>From 2015 to 2018 I flew back and forth about two dozen times from the San Francisco airport to the Seattle airport to visit Allison. On each of those flights I tried to get a right-hand seat on the flight north and a left-hand seat on the flight south, so that I would get to watch the Cascade volcanoes as they passed by my window. It seemed like it would make for such a beautiful trip to drive north and ski as many of the volcanoes as possible, but at the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ski (backcountry) and on top of that I had just sold my snowboard.</description>
